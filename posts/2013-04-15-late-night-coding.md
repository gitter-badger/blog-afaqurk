# Late Night Coding 

##### A rookie life-lesson in the life of a web developer

---

Much like many other developers, I have found nighttime to be a very productive time to work. The exact thing that did not work for me in college, works wonders now : working overnight to get something done. But there seemed to be a disagreement between myself and an older consultant developer at work, John. He summed it up as:

>"You think you're being productive [when you code overnight] but you're not. It's one of those things you will figure out around 30."

Now, I might not know much (being only 24 at this time), but gosh-nabbit I know when I'm being productive! Right? Overnight, there is no one to distract me. No support requests or chit-chat among co-workers. Something about the fact that everything around me is peaceful and quiet, allows me to focus my ADHD-inflicted millennial brain. Plus, I don't do it that often. And in any case, there's nothing John has been through that's really relevant as a developer these days.

That's what I thought up until a few weeks a go. I've since changed jobs and earned a tiny nugget of a life-lesson.

As it often is the case, the miscommunication between a 20-something year old and a 50-something year old had occurred due to the lack of one of them listening carefully. John wasn't trying to say that my time spent coding overnight was a waste in the literal sense. He was pointing out that it wasn't productive to my life. Here I was spending overnight typing away with all my brain-juices flowing; knocking out task after task. But why? When did these tasks pile up? Why could I only harness this motivated energy when no-one was around? How were these nights affecting my life routines the next day?

I won't tell you the series of events that helped me figure this out because life will give you your own: Its not the fact that you get a lot of work done overnight that makes it productive, its the fact that you are thinking clearly and aren't distracted. So, knowing that, what can you do to recreate this state-of-mind during the day?

Damn you, John. Damn you.
